### Summary

At Samespace, we’re constantly raising the bar for contact center technology. Our platform improves the agent experience and gives customer-facing teams access to advanced AI tools to manage conversations. Agents put up with a lot in their jobs, so we’re making it easier for them to do their best work. From virtual agents to live coaching, AI analytics to drag & drop IVR setup, we’re at the forefront of the industry.

As a Samespace SDR, you’ll quickly appreciate that our innovative software is also the best value in the industry. Our goal is to make modern contact center software affordable for growing and midsize businesses, and we have the freedom to pursue that goal as a proudly self-funded and cash flow positive company. We’re obsessed with customers, not VCs.
