Urban Company, an international home service company with over 5 million customers across 4 countries, needed a cloud contact center solution which can support a distributed international process. They found that in Samespace, and were very impressed with the results.

### Solution

To live up to its mission of empowering millions of service professionals by delivering services at-home in a way that has never been experienced before, it needed to stay ahead of the curve on customer experience.

As a growing startup, Urban Company was looking for a flexible and scalable solution allowing them to meet their changing requirements. They were not just looking for a solution, but were looking for a right partner.

"I am not sugar coating this, but the turnaround time of Samespace' service is amazing, I launched my operations in a new country (Australia) in less than 3 days, thats including implementation, testing and go-live.”

Their favorite part about Samespace is its ability to seamlessly integrate with any CRM. They found it married perfectly to their Instaview360 CRM and took only a short time to set up.

And Samespace’s affordable rates make it ideal for fast-growing businesses like Urban Company. Moreover, according to them, “The OPEX model is a win win for both the parties.”
