Shailesh leads the technology team and directs core strategy for the business.

Born in a remote village 200km north of Delhi, Shailesh displayed early signs of intense curiosity. By age seven he was skipping school and sneaking into the local sugarcane factory to figure out how the motors and engines worked.

Fast forward 10 years, he skipped school again, this time permanently. He left college in Mumbai after his first encounter with a computer, which gave him a glimpse into the limitless potential of something called The Internet to connect people faster and better than ever before.

Design thinker, technologist, and most importantly someone who deeply cares about todayâ€™s digital invasion, Shailesh is endlessly trying to build products that connect us more humanly.
