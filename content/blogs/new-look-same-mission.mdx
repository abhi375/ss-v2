Every team Zoom meeting we have here at Samespace, there comes a moment when our founder and CEO Shailesh Tyagi folds his arms, eyes cast to the side, brow furrowed. A problem will have come up that needs a complex solution, and ST (as we call him) knows it’s up to him to make a decision on how to solve it. Sometimes a full minute of silence goes by, but the next thing ST says, with quiet confidence, is the solution. Not the last word on it, mind you, but the first attempt in a series of attempts that will eventually lead to the right answer.

That’s how we do everything here at Samespace.

We take our time thinking through every possibility before choosing the best solution to our and our customers’ problems. Then we try it out, and think for a while again. If it works, it stays. If it doesn’t, it goes, no matter how trendy or flashy the feature. This balance between a restless drive to innovate and experiment, and a thoughtfully practical mindset, is at the core of who we are.

Here’s a breakdown of some of the biggest upgrades to our online presence and brand identity, and the motivation behind them. Whether you’re in tech, marketing, design, or just interested in the inner workings of a startup, you’ll find many things of interest in this, our inaugural blog post.

## The Logo

![Say Hello to New Together](/blogs/logo-grid.png)

In three words: Energy, Symmetry, Balance.

To inject new energy into our logo, the emblem of our company’s identity, we collaborated with the award winning [Raja Sandhu](https://www.rajasandhu.com/) and [Oleg Coada](https://dribbble.com/olegcoada) , the two of the world’s best designers. Our logo is a perfect circle having diagonal lines which simultaneously conjure a lightning strike, gears turning, the letter S, and the concept of symmetry itself.

Sectioning off the icon created two interlocking segments, sharing the same space (the last time I’ll lay it out so bluntly, I swear!), and created a sense of two swirling celestial bodies in an eternal bond around one another.

Balanced, harmonious, pragmatically minimal, but alive, dynamic, and ever evolving. Our new logo is a much better representation of who we really are.

## The Site

Our web design best reflects the design of our product. Minimal, efficient, sleek, but friendly, warm, and approachable. Just like our product is very easy to use for everyone, our site is also now better setup to optimize user experience. There’s less and more easily readable copy, giving you everything you need and nothing you don’t.

New illustrations have been commissioned to make the site more delightful to the eyes. We’re very excited to have begun collaborations with artists who will be creating content for us. Expect to see way more action on our social media accounts that’s just straight up pleasant content. Our new Head of Content Production and Strategy is determined to keep Samespace up to date with the latest looks and movements in visual design.

## The Message

We here at Samespace have all experienced call center work in one form or another, so we know how difficult the lives of agents can be. That’s why we’ve designed a product to make their workflows streamlined and easier. That’s not just a bit of product copy. We really did design it with our customers’ needs in mind. We want you and your coworkers daily work experience to be better in every way. Full stop.

## The Future

Just like our logo has two connected bodies in a constant conversation with one another, so too will we at Samespace be listening to you, our customers and colleagues. Tell us what you like and don’t about our product. We’re listening. We hear you. And we promise always to improve and innovate to make your experience better and better as the years go on.

The world is full of startups that flash brightly and fade away, fueled by investors whose whims determine their patronage. At Samespace, we’re financially able to sustain ourselves. That’s just to say, Samespace is truly built for the future. Not just in the sense that our product is always evolving to fit the most cutting edge advancements in tech, but simply that we as a company are going to be around for many years to come. A partnership with us is built to last.

## The New Together

So check out our new [site](https://www.samespace.com). Look around. Take it in. Tell us what you like. Tell us what you’d like to see in the future. We’re always open to hearing from you. You and we are here, sharing this space, figuratively and perhaps literally again some day. We and our customers, you and your customers. Using technology to bring and keep us in what we’re calling The New Together.
